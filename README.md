The ratio of retirements to mentees is nearly 47:1. While this does vary by department, that ratio is not lower than 40:1 for any individual department. This means, after evaluating other qualifications for good mentors, there should be sufficient employees near retirement to support the Mentorship Program.  The mentee count by department is shown below.
